## Description

I created a website for generating different random passwords based on criteria selected by the user of the website. Passwords are vital these days when you need accounts for every service, and your information needs to be more safe than ever. This website takes the criteria provided by the user and creates a unique password every time it is used. Every user will not select the same length or the same characters to be used in the password so every user will leave the website with their own fully unique and safe password. This website solves the issue of passwords being too similar or too easy to guess by creating unique randomized passwords with different characters every time. While developing this website i gained a better understanding of how to use javascript to create a website that is interactive and responsive to the user, because the satisfaction of the user is the main goal for every coding project.

## Installation

This project requires no installation for usage rather than opening the website, following the link in a browser of your choice, and then using the buttons to activate the functions of the website. The project was built using git bash and microsoft visual code.

## Usage

Usage of this website involves clicking the button and following through with the prompts in order to get the specified password character options that you would want. These include length of the password, which is to be typed in, and if you want uppercase letters, lowercase letters, symbols, and numbers in your password. These prompts come up in the form of "ok" or "cancel". If you want these characters hit ok, and if not hit cancel. Once these prompts are completed the password is returned in the box for it to be copied by the user.

## Credits

The completion of this project was aided by the efforts and assets of the rutgers computer science bootcamp. The lessons and challenges from the javascript of the class served as a backbone for the construction of this project.

## License

This project was completed using the MIT license.


## Features

Features that are present in this website are a button with an event listener that starts a function. This function then prompts the user via windows to provide feedback on what they would like their password to be. Once the feedback is recieved, the website then returns the password to the user in a text box for the user to copy and paste.
